# The developer toolkit

This is a collection of tools I use daily, all in a handy interactive cli tool.

## How to use

### Install

To install, download the latest release from the [releases page](/releases) and extract it to a directory in your path.

### Usage

Just run `tdtk`, it asks you to select a tool.

## Tools
